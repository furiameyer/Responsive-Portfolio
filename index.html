            <p class="About-me-text">Hi, I'm an executive with more than 20 years experience in consumer products and tech. After a long career in management, I've decided to take a year off to spend more time with my family and to pursue some of my hobbies, including coding.</p>
            <p class="About-me-text">I don't really expect to become a hardcore coder, but I do expect to become knowledgeable enough to be able to create cool stuff, have fun, and in the future better lead tech teams whenever I decide to go back to work.</p>
            <p class="About-me-text">Thank you for taking the time to visit this page. Please consider that this is the first time that I build a full profile website from scratch. As such, I welcome any feedback that you may have!</p>
